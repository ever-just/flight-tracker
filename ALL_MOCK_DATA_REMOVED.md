## ‚ö†Ô∏è HONEST LIMITATIONS

**What OpenSky Provides:**
- ‚úÖ Live flight positions (lat/long)
- ‚úÖ Altitude, speed, heading
- ‚úÖ Aircraft callsigns
- ‚úÖ Country of origin

**What OpenSky DOESN'T Provide:**
- ‚ùå Scheduled arrival/departure times
- ‚ùå Gate assignments
- ‚ùå Origin/destination airports (most flights)
- ‚ùå Flight status (on-time/delayed)

**Our Approach:**
- Show what we have (position, callsign, country)
- Mark unavailable fields as "N/A"
- Note limitations in API response
- Be honest with users!
