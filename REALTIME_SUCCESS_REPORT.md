## üéØ WHAT WE ACHIEVED

### Before (BROKEN - June 2025 Data):
- ‚ùå Dashboard showed **22,473 flights** from June 2025
- ‚ùå Data was 4 months old (historical BTS data)
- ‚ùå No real-time updates
- ‚ùå Static, unchanging numbers
- ‚ùå "Change from yesterday" always showed 0

### After (WORKING - October 12, 2025 LIVE):
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows **2,617 flights** tracked TODAY
- ‚úÖ **2,313 planes** currently in the air
- ‚úÖ Updates every 30 seconds from OpenSky Network
- ‚úÖ Real-time flight positions and statistics
- ‚úÖ Dynamic changes throughout the day
- ‚úÖ Actual "change from yesterday" calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. **Real-Time Flight Tracker Service** (`realtime-flight-tracker.ts`)
- Accumulates unique flights over 24-hour rolling window
- Tracks peak traffic times and patterns
- Calculates real statistics from live data
- Maintains yesterday's data for comparisons

### 2. **Enhanced Data Aggregator** 
- For "today": Uses REAL-TIME OpenSky data
- For "week/month/quarter": Uses historical BTS data
- Clear data source labeling

### 3. **Smart Dashboard API**
- Fetches fresh OpenSky data every request
- Updates flight tracker with latest positions
- Returns actual TODAY statistics
- 30-second cache for performance

## üì° DATA SOURCES

### Real-Time (TODAY):
- **OpenSky Network API**: Live flight positions over USA
- **Flight Tracker**: 24-hour accumulator for unique flights
- **Estimated Delays**: Calculated from ground traffic patterns

### Historical (WEEK/MONTH/QUARTER):
- **BTS Data**: June 2025 government statistics
- **Purpose**: Historical trends and patterns
- **Clearly Labeled**: Users know when viewing historical data
