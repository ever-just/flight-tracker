# Airport Detail Page - Comprehensive Review Plan

## Objective
Verify that the airport detail page shows accurate, real data without relying on mock data generators.

## Review Scope

### 1. Recent Flight Activity Section ✓
- **Status**: FIXED (just completed)
- **Verification**: API correctly filters flights by airport
- **Data Source**: `/api/flights/recent?airport={CODE}`

### 2. Key Metrics Cards
**Components to Review:**
- Total Flights (arrivals + departures)
- Delays (count + average delay time)
- Cancellations (count + percentage)
- On-Time Rate (percentage)

**Questions:**
- Where does this data come from?
- Is it real-time or mock?
- Does it aggregate from actual flight data?

### 3. Performance Comparisons
**Data Points:**
- Daily comparison (vs yesterday)
- Monthly comparison (vs last month)
- Yearly comparison (vs last year)

**Metrics per period:**
- Flight volume change
- Delays change
- Cancellations change
- On-Time performance change

**Questions:**
- Are these real historical comparisons?
- Or generated mock percentage changes?

### 4. Flight Types Breakdown
**Categories:**
- Domestic flights
- International flights
- Cargo flights
- Private flights

**Questions:**
- Is this data sourced from real APIs?
- Or generated randomly?

### 5. Flight Trends Chart
**Component**: `TrendChart`
**Questions:**
- What data does this visualize?
- Is it connected to real data sources?

### 6. Airport Header Information
**Data Points:**
- Airport code
- Airport name
- Status (Operational/Minor Delays/Major Delays/Closed)
- Coordinates
- Live tracking indicator

**Questions:**
- Is status calculated from real delay data?
- Are coordinates accurate?

## Files to Audit

1. `/src/app/airports/[code]/page.tsx` - Main component
2. `/src/app/api/airports/[code]/route.ts` - Airport detail API
3. `/src/app/api/dashboard/summary/route.ts` - Summary data source
4. `/src/services/real-data-aggregator.ts` - Data aggregation service
5. `/src/lib/airports-data.ts` - Static airport data

## Review Methodology

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
- Read source files
- Identify data sources
- Flag mock data generators
- Check API integrations

### Phase 2: API Testing
- Test each API endpoint
- Verify response structure
- Check data realism
- Confirm no mock fallbacks

### Phase 3: Data Flow Tracing
- Trace from API → Component → Display
- Verify data transformations
- Check for hardcoded values

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Document findings
- Identify mock data usage
- Recommend real data replacements
- Create implementation plan if needed

## Success Criteria
✅ No mock data generators in production code paths
✅ All metrics derived from real data sources
✅ Historical comparisons use actual historical data
✅ Status calculations based on real performance metrics
✅ Flight type breakdowns from real API data
