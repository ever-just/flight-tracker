## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Airport Recent Flights Not Filtered ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**  
Airport detail pages showed random flights instead of airport-specific flights.

**Example:**  
- PBI page showed: FLL→ATL, CLT→MCO (not PBI!)

**Fix:**  
Updated `/api/flights/recent` to filter by airport:
- Arrivals: OTHER → REQUESTED_AIRPORT
- Departures: REQUESTED_AIRPORT → OTHER

**Verification:**
- ATL shows only ATL flights ✓
- PBI shows only PBI flights ✓
- Works for all airports ✓

### Issue 2: Excessive Console Logs ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**  
Console spammed with "Fetched data" and "Transformed flights" logs

**Fix:**  
Removed debug console.log statements

**Verification:**
- Console is clean ✓
- Only info messages remain ✓

### Issue 3: Flights Page TypeError ✅ FIXED
**Problem:**  
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bg')`  
statusConfig[flight.status] was undefined for invalid statuses

**Fix:**  
Added fallback: `statusConfig[flight.status] || statusConfig['on-time']`

**Verification:**
- No more TypeError ✓
- Flights page loads ✓
