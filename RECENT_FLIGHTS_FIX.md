# Recent Flight Activity Fix - Airport Filtering

## Problem Identified
When navigating to a specific airport's detail page and viewing the "Recent Flight Activity" section, flights from OTHER airports were being shown incorrectly. The component was displaying flights that had no connection to the selected airport.

## Root Cause
The `/api/flights/recent` endpoint had a **cache contamination bug**:

1. The API used a single global cache (`lastFlights`, `lastUpdateTime`) for ALL airports
2. When you first loaded flights without a filter, it cached all flights globally
3. When you then navigated to a specific airport (e.g., LAX), the incremental update logic would:
   - Keep ALL the previous cached flights (even ones not involving LAX)
   - Only update their status fields
   - Show them all to the user

This meant if you visited the general flights page first, then navigated to LAX's detail page, you'd see flights from JFK, ORD, ATL, and many others that had nothing to do with LAX.

## Solution Implemented

### Changed from Global Cache to Per-Airport Cache
```typescript
// Before (WRONG):
let lastFlights: any[] = []
let lastUpdateTime = Date.now()

// After (CORRECT):
let lastFlightsCache: Map<string, any[]> = new Map()
let lastUpdateTimeCache: Map<string, number> = new Map()
```

### Cache Key Strategy
- Each airport gets its own cache key (e.g., "LAX", "JFK", "ORD")
- Unfiltered requests use the key "all"
- When fetching flights for LAX, only LAX's cached flights are retrieved
- When fetching flights for JFK, only JFK's cached flights are retrieved

### Code Changes
**File**: `/src/app/api/flights/recent/route.ts`

**Lines 3-5** (Cache Storage):
```typescript
let lastFlightsCache: Map<string, any[]> = new Map()
let lastUpdateTimeCache: Map<string, number> = new Map()
```

**Lines 35-39** (Cache Retrieval):
```typescript
const cacheKey = airportCode || 'all'
const lastFlights = lastFlightsCache.get(cacheKey) || []
const lastUpdateTime = lastUpdateTimeCache.get(cacheKey) || 0
const timeSinceLastUpdate = Date.now() - lastUpdateTime
```

**Lines 230-232** (Cache Update):
```typescript
const cacheKey = airportCode || 'all'
lastFlightsCache.set(cacheKey, flights)
lastUpdateTimeCache.set(cacheKey, Date.now())
```

## Verification

### Test Results
Tested with multiple airports to confirm correct filtering:

**LAX Test** (10 flights):
- ✅ All 10 flights involve LAX (either origin or destination)
- ✅ Mix of arrivals (DTW→LAX, PHX→LAX, JFK→LAX, ORD→LAX) and departures (LAX→JFK, LAX→EWR, LAX→CLT, etc.)
- ✅ Type field correctly set: "arrival" when destination=LAX, "departure" when origin=LAX

**JFK Test** (10 flights):
- ✅ All 10 flights involve JFK
- ✅ Mix of arrivals (TPA→JFK, PHX→JFK) and departures (JFK→MSP, JFK→DFW, JFK→PHX, etc.)
- ✅ Type field correctly set

**ORD Test** (5 flights):
- ✅ All 5 flights involve ORD
- ✅ Correct arrivals (SFO→ORD, LGA→ORD) and departures (ORD→DTW)
- ✅ Type field correctly set

### API Endpoint
```bash
# Test with specific airport
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/flights/recent?airport=LAX&limit=10"

# Test with another airport
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/flights/recent?airport=JFK&limit=10"

# Test without filter (all airports)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/flights/recent?limit=10"
```

## Impact
- ✅ Users now see ONLY flights relevant to the selected airport
- ✅ Each airport maintains its own realistic flight progression over time
- ✅ No cross-contamination between different airport views
- ✅ Cache still works for smooth updates and realistic incremental changes
- ✅ 30-second auto-refresh continues to work correctly

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/flights/recent/route.ts` - Fixed cache logic to use per-airport caching

## Status
✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED** - Ready for production deployment
