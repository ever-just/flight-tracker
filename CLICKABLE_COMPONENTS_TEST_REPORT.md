## **Technical Notes**

### Issues Fixed During Implementation:
1. ❌ **Missing UI Components** - Analytics page initially used `Tabs` and `Badge` from shadcn/ui
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Rewrote pages to use only `Card` component and custom styled divs
   
2. ❌ **Module Not Found Errors** - Components tried importing non-existent UI libraries
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Replaced all missing components with Tailwind-styled alternatives

3. ❌ **Server Restart Issues** - Dev server wasn't picking up new routes
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Properly restarted with full path: `cd flight-tracker && npm run dev`

### Files Created:
- `src/app/analytics/page.tsx` - Analytics dashboard with tabs
- `src/app/delays/page.tsx` - Delays tracker
- `src/app/flights/[id]/page.tsx` - Flight detail view

All components follow the existing design system:
- Deep black theme (`bg-aviation-dark`)
- Glass-card styling (`glass-card` class)
- Aviation sky accent color (`text-aviation-sky`)
- Consistent navigation and footer
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth hover transitions
