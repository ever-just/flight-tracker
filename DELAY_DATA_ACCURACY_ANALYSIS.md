# üîç Delay Data Accuracy Analysis - ORD Example

**Airport**: ORD (Chicago O'Hare)  
**Issue**: Delay count and percentage may be misleading  
**Reported By**: User review  

---

## üìä CURRENT DASHBOARD DISPLAY

```yaml
ORD - O'Hare International Airport
Flights: 63,446
Delays: 26,542 (41.8%)
```

**User's Question**: Is this accurate?

**Answer**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially accurate, but misleading**

---

## üéØ WHAT THE DATA ACTUALLY MEANS

### Source Data (BTS June 2025):
```
Total Flights at ORD: 63,446 ‚úÖ REAL
Avg Departure Delay: 23.3 minutes ‚úÖ REAL
Avg Arrival Delay: 25.1 minutes ‚úÖ REAL
Cancellation Rate: 0.96% ‚úÖ REAL
```

### Current Calculation:
```typescript
// Line 65 in dashboard/summary/route.ts:
delays = Math.round(flights √ó (avgDelay / 60))
      = Math.round(63,446 √ó (25.1 / 60))
      = Math.round(63,446 √ó 0.4183)
      = 26,542

percentage = (26,542 / 63,446) √ó 100 = 41.8%
```

---

## ‚ùå **WHY THIS IS MISLEADING**

### Problem 1: Meaningless Formula
**The calculation** `flights √ó (avgDelay / 60)` **doesn't represent anything real!**

It's not:
- ‚ùå Number of delayed flights
- ‚ùå Total delay hours
- ‚ùå Delay-weighted metric
- ‚ùå Any standard aviation metric

It's essentially: **"Total flights √ó (fraction of an hour)"** = meaningless number

### Problem 2: False Interpretation
**Dashboard implies**: "26,542 flights (41.8%) were delayed"

**Reality**: We don't know how many flights were delayed!

**With 25.1 min average delay:**
- Could be: 20% delayed by 125 minutes, 80% on-time
- Could be: 100% delayed by 25.1 minutes
- Could be: 50% delayed by 50 minutes, 50% on-time

**We CAN'T determine delay count from just the average!**

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW (From BTS)**

### Accurate Metrics:
1. **Total Flights**: 63,446 ‚úÖ
2. **Average Delay**: 25.1 minutes ‚úÖ
3. **Cancellation Rate**: 0.96% (609 flights) ‚úÖ
4. **Departures/Arrivals Split**: 31,730 / 31,716 ‚úÖ

### What BTS CSV Contains (But We Didn't Parse):
The original CSV has fields like:
- `ArrDel15`: Binary indicator (1 = delayed >15 min, 0 = on-time)
- `DepDel15`: Same for departures
- `ArrDelayMinutes`: Actual delay in minutes
- `DepDelayMinutes`: Actual delay in minutes

**If we parsed these**, we could accurately say:
- "42,300 flights (67%) arrived on-time"
- "21,146 flights (33%) delayed >15 minutes"

## üîß **RECOMMENDED FIXES**

### Option 1: Show Average Delay (Honest & Simple)
**Change Display To:**
```yaml
ORD
Flights: 63,446
Avg Delay: 25.1 min
Cancellations: 609 (0.96%)
```

**Pros**: Accurate, honest, matches BTS data  
**Cons**: Doesn't show volume of delays

### Option 2: Re-Parse BTS with Delay Indicators
**Update** `scripts/parse-bts-data.js` to count:
```javascript
// In BTS parser:
if (row.ArrDel15 === '1.00') {
  stats.delayedFlights++
}

// Then accurately show:
Delayed Flights: 21,146 (33.3%) ‚Üê Real count!
```

**Pros**: Fully accurate  
**Cons**: Need to re-parse 674K rows (~5 min)

### Option 3: Estimate with Disclaimer
```yaml
ORD
Flights: 63,446
Est. Delayed: ~40,000 (est.)
Note: Based on 25.1 min avg delay
```

**Pros**: Shows volume estimate  
**Cons**: Not precise

## üìà **WHAT OTHER DASHBOARDS DO**

### FlightAware, FlightRadar24:
- Show: "Average Delay: 25 minutes"
- Show: "On-Time Performance: 68%"  
- Don't show: Delay count (because it's complex)

### FAA Dashboard:
- Shows: Delay severity (Minor/Moderate/Severe)
- Shows: Average delay in minutes
- Shows: % of flights delayed (from actual counts)

---

## üéØ **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**Change to show what we actually know:**

```typescript
// In airport card component:
{
  code: "ORD",
  flights: 63446,
  avgDelay: 25.1,  // ‚Üê Show this clearly
  delayStatus: "Moderate Delays",  // Based on avg
  cancellations: 609
}

// Display as:
ORD
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
Flights: 63,446
Status: Moderate Delays (25.1 min avg)
Cancellations: 609 (0.96%)
```

Or if we want to keep showing a count:

```typescript
// More honest estimation:
// Assume delays follow normal distribution
// With 25.1 min average, estimate ~60-70% had some delay
const estimatedDelayed = Math.round(flights * 0.65)
const note = "estimated based on avg delay"
```

---

## üìù **BOTTOM LINE**

**Current Data:**
- ‚úÖ Flights (63,446): ACCURATE
- ‚úÖ Avg Delay (25.1 min): ACCURATE
- ‚ùå Delay Count (26,542): MISLEADING CALCULATION
- ‚ùå Delay % (41.8%): MEANINGLESS

**Recommendation**: 
1. **Quick Fix**: Change label from "Delays: 26,542" to "Avg Delay: 25.1 min"
2. **Proper Fix**: Re-parse BTS CSV to count actual delayed flights
3. **Best UX**: Show delay severity indicator (Normal/Moderate/Severe) based on average
