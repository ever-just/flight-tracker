# Dashboard Fix Report

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Dashboard Period Toggle Not Working
**Problem:** When selecting "This Week", "This Month", or "This Quarter", the numbers remained static (28,453 flights)

**Root Cause:** 
- Frontend was using absolute URLs with environment variable fallback
- `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'`
- This caused CORS errors in production and fetch failures

**Solution:**
- Changed to relative URL: `/api/dashboard/summary?period=${period}`
- Now works in both local and production environments

### 2. Real-Time Updates Not Working
**Problem:** Dashboard showed "Last updated" time changing but data remained static

**Root Cause:**
- Same fetch failure issue - falling back to static mockDashboardData
- refetchInterval had no effect because fetch was failing

**Solution:**
- Fixed with relative URL change
- API now properly returns scaled data based on period

### 3. Chart Not Loading (Localhost)
**Problem:** Chart showed "Loading chart..." indefinitely

**Root Cause:**
- Data structure mismatch between API response and component props
- Component expected `dailyTrends` but API returned `trends.daily`

**Solution:**
- Updated prop to: `data={dashboardData.trends?.daily || []}`
- Chart now receives correct data structure

### 4. API 500 Error (Localhost)
**Problem:** API returned 500 error causing all features to fail

**Root Cause:**
- Issue with cache module import in API route

**Temporary Solution:**
- Commented out cache import to restore functionality
- API now works properly

## Code Changes
