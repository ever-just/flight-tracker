## CRITICAL ISSUES (P0) - Implementation Review

### 1. ✅ OpenSky Authentication Failure
**Original Plan:**
- Fix 401 Unauthorized error
- Implement Basic Auth or OAuth2
- Target: 4000 requests/day

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **OAuth2 Successfully Implemented** with client credentials flow
- ✅ Client ID: `everjust-api-client` 
- ✅ Client Secret: `VhRMAyCzTbHb8KpZrHEQcEKWQZsrYY0g`
- ✅ Token endpoint: `https://auth.opensky-network.org/auth/realms/opensky-network/protocol/openid-connect/token`

✅ Token type: Bearer
✅ Expires in: 1800 seconds
✅ API Rate Limit: 3999/4000 (confirmed 10x increase)
✅ Successfully retrieved 56 live flights
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/real-opensky.service.ts` (lines 46-86)
- `src/app/api/flights/live/route.ts` (OAuth2 integration)

---

### 2. ✅ FAA API Returns HTML Instead of JSON
**Original Plan:**
- Update to correct ASWS endpoint

- Add NOAA fallback

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **FAA ASWS API Approved** - Airport Watch application
- ✅ Correct endpoint: `https://external-api.faa.gov/asws/v1/airport/status/`

- ✅ Client Secret: `5880f72C66924020a27E0101caB08f22`
- ✅ NOAA Weather API fallback implemented
- ✅ Error handling for both APIs

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ FAA credentials configured
✅ NOAA fallback working
✅ Weather delay data available
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/faa.service.ts` (lines 40-103)

---

### 3. ✅ Flight History File Size (200MB+)
**Original Plan:**
- Implement file rotation at 10MB
- Add 7-day retention
- Create migration script

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **File rotation at 10MB limit** implemented
- ✅ **7-day data retention** policy active
- ✅ **Hourly cleanup** scheduled
- ✅ **Compression with gzip** for archives
- ✅ **Migration script** created and working

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ Original file: 200MB+
✅ Current file: 4.61MB (98% reduction!)
✅ Rotation working
✅ Archives created in data/archives/
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/realtime-flight-tracker.ts` (rotation logic)
- `scripts/migrate-flight-history.js` (NEW - migration script)

---

### 4. ✅ Live Flights API Returns Mock Data
**Original Plan:**

- Fix response structure
- Add proper metadata

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **Real OpenSky data** with OAuth2
- ✅ **Proper response structure** with metadata
- ✅ **Cache headers** added
- ✅ **Count field** included
- ✅ **Data quality indicator** shows "REAL"

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ Source: opensky-real
✅ Flights: 50+ real flights
✅ Quality: REAL - OpenSky Network ADS-B Data
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/flights/live/route.ts` (lines 15-113)

---

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (P1) - Implementation Review

### 5. ✅ Recent Flights Missing Summary Object
**Original Plan:**
- Add summary object with statistics
- Include time range, counts by status

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **Complete summary object** added
- ✅ Total flights, airports, time range
- ✅ Counts by status (onTime, delayed, cancelled, etc.)
- ✅ Counts by type (arrivals, departures)

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ Recent Flights: PASSED - 10 flights with summary
✅ Summary object structure validated
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/flights/recent/route.ts` (summary object added)

---

### 6. ✅ Airports API Wrong Response Format
**Original Plan:**
- Return array directly
- Remove wrapper object

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **Direct array returned**
- ✅ No wrapper object
- ✅ Frontend iteration working

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ Airports: PASSED - 99 airports returned as array
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/airports/route.ts` (return statement fixed)

---

### 7. ✅ Health Check Wrong Status Format
**Original Plan:**
- Return "ok" instead of "healthy"
- Adjust HTTP status codes

**What Was Implemented:**
- ✅ **Status returns "ok"** for healthy state
- ✅ **"degraded"** for partial issues
- ✅ **"error"** for critical issues
- ✅ HTTP status codes: 200, 206, 500

**Test Results:**
```bash
✅ Health Check: PASSED - Status: "ok"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` (status mapping updated)

---

## Additional Implementations (Not in Original Plan)

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite
