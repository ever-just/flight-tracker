- Error Scenarios

**95 minute audit timeline defined**

### ✅ 4. Created Optimization Plan
**File:** `OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`

**Priorities:**
- 🔴 Critical: Fix API loading, chart rendering
- 🟡 High: Performance improvements, bundle size reduction
- 🟢 Medium: UX enhancements, loading states
- 🔵 Low: Advanced features, analytics

**Target Metrics:**
- Bundle Size: <150KB (-20%)
- Page Load: <1.5s (-25%)
- API Calls: 2-3 per page (-50%)
- Lighthouse Score: >90

### ✅ 5. Implemented All Optimizations

#### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Dynamic imports for Flight Trends chart
- ✅ Lazy loading with SSR disabled for heavy components
- ✅ Better cache headers (s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=120)
- ✅ Fixed API fetching (relative URLs vs absolute)

#### UX Improvements
- ✅ Error Boundary components for graceful failures
- ✅ Loading Skeleton components for better perceived performance
- ✅ Replaced basic loading with skeleton cards
- ✅ Loading states for charts

#### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Fixed dependency chain (added nanoid)
- ✅ Moved autoprefixer, postcss, tailwindcss to dependencies
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors (cancellations, map parameters, cache iteration, Status enum)
- ✅ Updated tsconfig for ES2015 target

#### SEO & PWA
- ✅ Updated meta tags (robots, theme color #000000)
- ✅ Created manifest.json for PWA support
- ✅ Proper meta descriptions and OpenGraph tags

### ✅ 6. Tested Implementation Thoroughly

**Production Tests:**
- ✅ Dashboard loading correctly
- ✅ Period toggles working (Today/Week/Month/Quarter)
- ✅ Flight Trends chart rendering
- ✅ Airports page showing 99 airports
- ✅ Airport cards clickable
- ✅ Live Map working with 50 flights
- ✅ All navigation links functional
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Error handling working
- ✅ Loading states showing

## 🔧 Technical Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Build Failures
**Problem:** Multiple build failures on DigitalOcean  
**Root Cause:** Missing nanoid dependency  
**Solution:** `npm install nanoid`  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Secrets Exposed  
**Problem:** API keys committed to GitHub  
**Solution:** Used `git-filter-repo` to clean history  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED & SECURED

### Issue #3: Airports Page Not Loading
**Problem:** Fetch using wrong base URL  
**Solution:** Changed to relative URLs  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #4: Chart Not Rendering Locally
**Problem:** Build artifacts not complete  
**Solution:** Dynamic import with loading state  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #5: TypeScript Errors
**Problems:**
- Missing cancellations property
- Implicit any types
- Iterator errors
- Missing Status enum

**Solutions:**
- Added cancellations to comparisons
- Added explicit types
- Used Array.from() for iteration
- Created Status enum

**Status:** ✅ ALL RESOLVED

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Dependency Management  
- Always test builds locally before deploying
- `devDependencies` get pruned in production builds
- PostCSS needs explicit peer dependencies

### 2. Security
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `git-filter-repo` (not deprecated filter-branch)
- Always check .gitignore before first commit

### 3. DigitalOcean MCP
- Use "DigitalOcean2" MCP (174 tools), not "digitalocean"
- Use `git.repo_clone_url` for public repos
- Monitor deployments with `apps-get-deployment-status`

### 4. Next.js Production
- Standalone output requires specific setup
- buildpacks auto-detect work better for Next.js
- Dynamic imports need `ssr: false` for charts
